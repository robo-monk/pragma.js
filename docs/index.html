      <h1> About </h1>
      <p> 
        Welcome! Pragma is a not-really-"framework", which provides a really powerful way to build UIs and apps with
        JavaScript. It doesn't make any assumptions about the rest of your workflow, you can use it as much as you want, or as little as you like. Its fully customizable and built to be extensible. 
        <br><br>
        Its still in early development and some features are missing like the css. It depends on a couple of libraries, and jquery which can easily be removed later on.
        <br><br>
        I hope you enjoy it and create some epic shit with it.

          In the Nimzo-Indian, Black is generally prepared to concede the bishop pair by playing Bxc3. As dynamic compensation, he
          often doubles White's c-pawns, which represent a static weakness, and gains play against the central light squares d5
          and e4, even in those instances where White is able to recapture with a piece after ...Bxc3. Black will aim to close the
          position to reduce the scope of White's bishops. To this end, Black must blockade the white pawn centre from advancing
          and neutralise White's attacking chances on the kingside. An example of Black's strategy carried out successfully is the
          game Mikhail Botvinnik–Samuel Reshevsky from the 1948 World Chess Championship,[1] which reached the position in the
          diagram after White's 24th move.
Elon Reeve Musk FRS ( EE -lon ; born June 28, 1971) is a business magnate , industrial designer and engineer . [6] He is
the founder, CEO , CTO and chief designer of SpaceX ; early investor, [b] CEO and product architect of Tesla, Inc. ;
founder of The Boring Company ; co-founder of Neuralink ; and co-founder and initial co-chairman of OpenAI . He was
elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 2018 . [9] [10] Also that year, he was ranked 25th on the Forbes list of
The World's Most Powerful People , [11] and was ranked joint-first on the Forbes list of the Most Innovative Leaders of
2019. [12] Musk's net worth jumped by up to US$7 billion after end of November 2020. As of December 8, 2020, Forbes
estimated his net worth at US$ 144.1 billion, [1] [13] making him the second-richest person in the world, behind Jeff
Bezos . [14]

Musk was born to a Canadian mother and South African father and raised in Pretoria , South Africa. He briefly attended
the University of Pretoria before moving to Canada when he was 17 to attend Queen's University . He transferred to the
University of Pennsylvania two years later, where he received dual bachelor's degrees in economics and physics. He moved
to California in 1995 to begin a Ph.D. in applied physics and material sciences at Stanford University , but dropped out
after two days to pursue a business career. He co-founded Zip2 , a web software company, which was acquired by Compaq
for $307 million in 1999. Musk then founded X.com , an online bank. It merged with Confinity in 2000, which had launched
PayPal the previous year and was subsequently bought by eBay for $1.5 billion in October 2002.

In May 2002, Musk founded SpaceX , an aerospace manufacturer and space transport services company, of which he is CEO
and lead designer. He joined Tesla Motors, Inc. (now Tesla, Inc. ), an electric vehicle manufacturer, in 2004, the year
after it was founded, becoming its product architect that year and its CEO in 2008. In 2006, he helped create SolarCity
, a solar energy services company (now a subsidiary of Tesla). In 2015, he co-founded OpenAI, a nonprofit research
company that aims to promote friendly artificial intelligence . In July 2016, he co-founded Neuralink, a neurotechnology
company focused on developing brain–computer interfaces . In December 2016, Musk founded The Boring Company , an
infrastructure and tunnel construction company focused on tunnels optimized for electric vehicles. In addition to his
primary business pursuits, he envisioned an open-source high-speed transportation system known as the Hyperloop based on
the concept of a vactrain .

Musk has also been the subject of criticism due to unorthodox or unscientific stances and highly publicized
controversies. After his submarine was rejected as a viable option for the 2018 Tham Luang cave rescue , he called a
diver advising the rescue a "pedo guy". The diver sued Musk for defamation; a California jury ruled in favor of Musk.
Also in 2018, he falsely tweeted that he had secured funding for a private takeover of Tesla at $420 a share. The U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission sued him for the comment; he temporarily stepped down from chairman and settled with
the SEC; the settlement included limitations on his Twitter usage. Musk has also received substantial criticism for his
views on artificial intelligence, public transportation, and the COVID-19 pandemic .

Early life and family
Elon Reeve Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria , Transvaal, South Africa. [15] [16] His mother is Maye Musk (
née Haldeman), a model and dietitian born in Saskatchewan , Canada, [17] [18] [19] but raised in South Africa. His
father is Errol Musk, a South African electromechanical engineer , pilot, sailor, consultant and property developer.
[20] He has a younger brother who was an early business partner of his, Kimbal (born 1972), and a younger sister, Tosca
(born 1974), the CEO of the video streaming site Passionflix . [19] [21] [25] His maternal grandfather, Joshua Haldeman,
was an American-born Canadian. [26] His paternal grandmother had both British and Pennsylvania Dutch ancestry. [27] [28]

After his parents divorced in 1980, Musk lived mostly with his father in the suburbs of Pretoria, [27] a choice he made
two years after his parents separated but which he subsequently regretted. [29] Musk has become estranged from his
father, whom he has described as "a terrible human being... Almost every evil thing you could possibly think of, he has
done." [29] He also has a half-sister [30] and a half-brother on his father's side. [31]

During his childhood, Musk was an avid reader. [32] At the age of 10, he developed an interest in computing while using
the Commodore VIC-20 . [33] He learned computer programming using a manual and, by the age of 12, sold the code of a
BASIC -based video game he created called Blastar to PC and Office Technology magazine for approximately $500. [34] [35]
His childhood reading included Isaac Asimov's Foundation series , from which he drew the lesson that "you should try to
take the set of actions that are likely to prolong civilization, minimize the probability of a dark age and reduce the
length of a dark age if there is one". [29]



Musk was severely bullied throughout his childhood and was once hospitalized after a group of boys threw him down a
flight of stairs. [29] [36] [37] He attended Waterkloof House Preparatory School and Bryanston High School [37] before
graduating from Pretoria Boys High School . [38]

Although Musk's father insisted that Elon go to college in Pretoria, Musk became determined to move to the United
States, saying "I remember thinking and seeing that America is where great things are possible, more than any other
country in the world." [39] Musk knew it would be easier to get to the United States from Canada and moved there against
his father's wishes in June 1989, just before his 18th birthday, [40] [41] after obtaining a Canadian passport through
his Canadian-born mother. [42] [43]

Education
While awaiting Canadian documentation, Musk attended the University of Pretoria for five months. [44] Once in Canada,
Musk entered Queen's University in 1989, avoiding mandatory service in the South African military . [45] He left in 1992
to study economics and physics at the University of Pennsylvania ; he graduated in 1997 with a Bachelor of Science (BS)
degree in economics from the Wharton School and a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree in physics from the College of Arts and
Sciences . [46] [47] [48]

In 1994, Musk held two internships in Silicon Valley during the summer: at an energy storage start-up called Pinnacle
Research Institute, which researched electrolytic ultracapacitors for energy storage, and at the Palo Alto-based
start-up Rocket Science Games. [49] Bruce Leak , the former lead engineer behind Apple's QuickTime who had hired Musk,
noted: "He had boundless energy. Kids these days have no idea about hardware or how stuff works, but he had a PC hacker
background and was not afraid to just go figure things out." [50]

In 1995, Musk was accepted to a Ph.D. program in energy physics / materials science at Stanford University in
California. [51] [ non-primary source needed ] In California, Musk attempted to get a job at Netscape , but he says that
he never received a response to his job inquiries. [52] He ended up dropping out of Stanford after two days, deciding
instead to join the Internet boom and launch an internet startup instead. [53]
